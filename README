FLANN - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest neighbors
======================================================

This is a library for fast approximate nearest neighbor matching. 
See the doc/manual.pdf file for information on how to use the library.

From Joseph Turian:

I have forked flann-1.2 from
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN
in order to make the following changes:

* Added a DOT distance measure.
  This is 1-dot(x,y).
  WARNING: I don't know if this will break FLANN if your dot-product is
  outside the range of [0,1], but mine never are because I pre-normalize.
  You could alternately implement the normalization as the cosine
  similarity (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), but I
  don't do that since it would make the inner loop less efficient.
